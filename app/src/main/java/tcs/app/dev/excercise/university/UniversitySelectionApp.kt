/**
 * # University selection app
 * We want to write a simple app (with questionable usefulness) that has two screens:
 * 1. On the first screen you can select a university.
 * 2. After the selection we can go to the second screen,
 *   which displays the uni logo and further description.
 *
 * # UI
 * We will build the UI of the app component-wise in a bottom-up manner.
 * Monitor your UI using [Preview].
 * You can use [LMU], [TUM] and [Universities] as mock data.
 *
 * ## Tasks:
 * - First, we create a composable function `RadioRow`, which will be an selectable "element".
 *   We want to add an image on the left, a title in the middle and a `RadioButton` on the right.
 * - `RadioRow` should take four parameters:
 *   1. `image: Painter`: This image should be shown on the left.
 *   2. `title: String`: The title in the middle.
 *   3. `selected: Boolean`: This indicates if the `RadioButton` is selected or not.
 *   4. `modifier: Modifier = Modifier`: See best practices.
 * - Try displaying the three parameters using [Image], [Text] and [RadioButton].
 * - Use the [Row] layout to display the 3 elements next to each other.
 * - Style our UI Elements with the following parameters and [Modifier]s.
 *   Always monitor what is happening and read up in the documentation.
 *   [Row]: [fillMaxWidth], [padding], [Alignment], [Arrangement];
 *   [Image]: [size], [clip];
 *   [Text]: [RowScope.weight], [padding];
 *   [RadioButton]: [padding].
 *   Try around with different values until it looks "good".
 * - We also want to give the `RadioRow` a background and a border:
 *   Wrap everything in a [Surface], and give it a border and rounded corners.
 *   Set the color of the surface and the border depending on the parameter `selected`.
 * - Overload `RadioRow` twice:
 *   1. Use the slot API pattern for `image` and `title`.
 *   2. Take an [Option] as parameter.
 * - Create a composable function `SelectionScreen` with the parameters:
 *    - `title: String`
 *    - `options: List<Option>`
 * - Use the slot API of the [Scaffold] layout:
 *   1. The top bar should consist of a checkbox [Icon] and the title.
 *   You can use [Row] or if you feel fancy try [TopAppBar] or [CenterAlignedTopAppBar].
 *   2. In the body display the `options` in a row using a `for`-loop.
 *   3. The bottom bar should contain a [Button] that says "Next".
 * - For the styling of the `SelectionScreen` use what you learned until now.
 * - Create a composable function `DetailsScreen` that shows the contents of a [Option] on the
 *   whole screen. Use a [Column] layout. For the styling use what you learned until now.

 *
 * # State
 * We created our UI but cannot interact with it yet.
 * Now, we have to add logic and state.
 * From now on to try out your app using an emulator.
 * For that, call [UniversitySelectionApp] in [MainActivity]
 * and put what you want to try out in [UniversitySelectionApp].
 *
 * ## Tasks:
 * - We want to listen to clicks on the `RadioRow`s.
 *   For that, add a parameter `onSelected: () -> Unit = {}` to `RadioRow`.
 *   Listen to click events of the [Surface] using its `onClick` parameter
 *   and call `onSelected` when it's clicked.
 *   Like this, we give control to the caller of `RadioRow` over what is happening when it is clicked.
 *   This pattern is called state hoisting.
 * - Now, we actually want to display the selection of an option.
 *   We want that max 1 option is selected at once.
 *   For that, store the current selection in the `Selection` screen.
 *   We cannot do with a simple variable, because composable functions have not state by default.
 *   We have to use [remember] with [mutableStateOf] inside it to store an [Option].
 *   Since we don't have a selection in the beginning store a `Option?` with `null` as initial value.
 *   We can use property delegation, such that we do not have to deal with [MutableState] directly.
 * - Connect the state to the `RadioRow` using it's `onSelected` parameter
 *   and also set its `selected` parameter correctly.
 * - If you try it out on the emulator and change the screen orientation or the dark/bright mode,
 *   you'll see that the selection is gone.
 *   This is because [remember] does not survive configuration changes.
 *   If you want to change this, you can use [rememberSaveable].
 *   This just works with state that is saveable in the `Bundle`.
 *   For this reason we made [Option] confirm [Parcelable].
 *   Another possibility would be to just store an id instead of the [Option] object as state.
 * - Next, we want to connect the state to the "Next" button on the `SelectionScreen`.
 *   Enable the [Button] if a selection is made.
 *   Hoist its `onClick` event as a parameter `onSelected: (Option) -> Unit`.
 * - Finally, we want to connect our two screens in [UniversitySelectionApp].
 *   Store selections made by `SelectionScreen`.
 *   Show `SelectionScreen` until a selection is made.
 *   If a selection is made show `DetailsScreen` with the selection.

 *
 * # Bonus
 *
 * ## Tasks:
 * - Right now we cannot get back from the `DetailsScreen` to the `SelectionScreen`.
 *   If we press the back button of the phone, the app closes.
 *   To change this, we can use [BackHandler] in [UniversitySelectionApp]
 *   and set the selection to `null` if the back button is pressed.
 *   (In bigger apps we do not want to deal with this kind of navigation everywhere manually.
 *   You can use the compose navigation library for that.
 *   It also features animations on screen transitions.)
 * - An app feels more natural and polished with animations.
 *   We want to add a new feature with an animation to the `RadioRow`:
 *   1. Add a new parameter to `RadioRow` such that it also takes the description of an [Option].
 *   2. Create a state `expanded: Boolean` with default value `false`.
 *   3. Flip `expanded` on a long click on the [Surface] using [combinedClickable].
 *   4. If `expanded` is `true` show the `description` under the [Row] using a [Column].
 *   5. Animate the size of the [Column] using [animateContentSize].
 *      You can use for example `spring(dampingRatio = Spring.DampingRatioMediumBouncy, stiffness = Spring.StiffnessLow)`
 *   (Another way would be to use [animateDpAsState] instead of [animateContentSize].)
 * - If we expand the selection options, would have more options or are on smaller device,
 *   we are might not able to fit all the options on the screen.
 *   A good solution is to make the selections list scrollable.
 *   This is possible with either [Modifier.scrollable] or by replacing [Column] with a [LazyColumn].
 *   Try out [LazyColumn]!
